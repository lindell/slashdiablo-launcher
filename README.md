## About the project

Slashdiablo launcher is a cross platform game launcher for Diablo II and specifically the [Slashdiablo](https://old.reddit.com/r/slashdiablo/) community.

## Development

### Go
Install Go 1.12 or higher by following  [install instructions](http://golang.org/doc/install.html) for your OS.

### Qt bindings for Go
Before you can build you need to install the [Go/Qt bindings](https://github.com/therecipe/qt/wiki/Installation#regular-installation).

###  Install Qt5

#### OSX
On OSX using brew is by far the most simple way of installing Qt5.
```bash
$ brew install qt
```

#### Windows
Use the [installer](https://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/5.13/5.13.0/qt-opensource-windows-x86-5.13.0.exe) provided by Qt (Make sure you install the MinGW build of Qt).

#### Building Slashdiablo launcher

```bash
# Get binding source
$ go get -u -v -tags=no_env github.com/therecipe/qt/cmd/...

# Download the repository with dependencies
$ go get -d -u -v github.com/lindell/slashdiablo-launcher

# Build the launcher
$ cd $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/lindell/slashdiablo-launcher
$ qtdeploy build

# Start launcher (different depending on OS)
$ ./deploy/darwin/slashdiablo-launcher.app/Contents/MacOS/slashdiablo-launcher
```

## Deploying

Deploying to a target can be done from any host OS if there's a docker image available,
otherwise the target OS and the host must be the same.

### Windows

```bash
$ docker pull therecipe/qt:windows_64_static
$ qtdeploy -docker build windows_64_static

```

### MacOS (from MacOS only)

```bash
$ qtdeploy build darwin github.com/lindell/slashdiablo-launcher
```
